GitHub-Flavored Markdown for Python
===================================

**PLEASE READ BEFORE USING:**
**This repository will not receive bug fixes, and might become read-only soon.**

Rationale: this library has well-known `consistency issues`_ with GitHub-Flavored Markdown rendering. Fixing
them would require time investment the maintainer cannot provide. The maintainer is also fatigued by
Markdown's library constantly breaking their internal API with each minor release.

**Consider instead using** |pycmarkgfm|_ (PyPi_), a lightweight Python 3.5+ wrapper for GitHub's 
own implementation of GFM from the same author,
which is faster, virtually byte-compatible with GitHub rendering,
and provides a nice API for managing task lists aka. TODO lists.

|Build status| |Coverage status| |Documentation status|

This is an implementation of `GitHub-Flavored Markdown`_ written as an
extension to the Python `Markdown`_ library. It aims for, but does not
achieve, maximal compatibility with GitHub's rendering.

Tested Python versions are 3.5 to 3.8. Sorry, no Python 2.7 support starting
with py-gfm 1.x since the Python Markdown library itself is Python 3 only.

Documentation
-------------

You can browse or download the precompiled documentation
on `Read the Docs`_.

To build the Sphinx documentation from source, use::

   cd doc && make html

Supported features
------------------

-  Fenced code blocks
-  Literal line breaks
-  Tables
-  Hyperlink parsing (``http``, ``https``, ``ftp``, ``email`` and
   ``www`` subdomains)
-  Code highlighting for code blocks if Pygments is available
-  Mixed-style lists with no separation
-  Strikethrough
-  Task lists

Unsupported features and known differences
------------------------------------------

py-gfm is a pure Python implementation based on the Python Markdown library and
therefore cannot reproduce GitHub's `own implementation`_ with 100% accuracy.

See `the docs`_ for a list of known discrepancies.
